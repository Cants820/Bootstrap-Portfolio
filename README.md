# Bootstrap-Portfolio

#The components I used for the homework were navbar, page header, panels, and thumbnails. My grid layout for my site: index.html had 3 rows, row had two columns for the content and sidebar. I was suppose to float the <p> section right beside my profile picture but I was unable to. I tried setting both elements profile and <p> in two separate rows but it did not work. 
#contact was forward 3 rows and no columns. I used the form component as a template.
#portfolio I made 3 rows. The middle row had several columns to fix each work/project box. I used the thumbnail box with caption. For the caption, I made the text position: absolute and moved the box from the bottom up to overlap the thumbnail.
